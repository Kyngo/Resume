# Resume

This is the actual resume I share with HR and talent acquisition staff. As I mention in it, it is done entirely in LaTeX.

## Generating the PDF

You must use XeLaTeX or LuaTeX as the compiler. I personally use XeLaTeX on texmaker.

The Ubuntu font family has to be installed in order for the resume to build.

An example of how it's built is available in the Github Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/main.yml`).

## Download a prebuilt version

You can download the latest prebuilt version on the Releases section of the repository. Every time I push a new version, Github Actions will build it automatically.
